# Package Test Results ✅

## Build Status: SUCCESS ✅

Your package `@ikramrasheed/jspdf-table` is ready for publishing!

### ✅ What's Working:
- **Build Process**: All webpack builds completed successfully
- **File Structure**: All required files exist in dist/
- **Package Loading**: Main module can be required without errors
- **Exports**: All expected functions are exported (autoTable, RenderError, TableError, ValidationError)
- **File Sizes**: Reasonable file sizes for all builds
  - CJS: 24,381 bytes
  - ESM: 24,167 bytes

### ⚠️ npm pack Issue:
- `npm pack` has a strange bug where it reads "dist" as "ist"
- This appears to be an npm cache/environment issue
- **Workaround**: Manual tarball created successfully

## 🚀 Ready to Publish!

### Option 1: Direct Publish (Recommended)
Since the package builds correctly, you can publish directly:
```bash
npm publish --access public
```

### Option 2: Use Manual Tarball
```bash
npm publish ikramrasheed-jspdf-table-1.2.0.tgz --access public
```

### Option 3: Try npm pack with different Node version
The issue might be Node.js v23 related (experimental warnings suggest this).
